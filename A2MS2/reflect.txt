\f0\fs24 \cf0 The milestone 1 and 2 of assignment 2 was about the same contents but modifying and adding more commands in the program. I was able to use functions and replace all the long commands in the function and use four more header and source files other than the main code file. \
\
In this assignment I was using functions instead of just using long  of loops and other commands. Function could replace all the repetitive uses of set of same commands, for example I could replace all the commands that scans the answer if it is Y, y, N, or n,  so that I don\'92t have to repeat all the long lines of commands. Incase if we need to modify the whole program, using functions instead of commands are more useful since we only have to make changes in the function or just using different functions. \

\cf0 Use of the helper functions in a separate source file was much easier to call the functions to use in the main source code file and not confusing. Those functions was not included in the contacts module because it already had the contents from the helper header file.}

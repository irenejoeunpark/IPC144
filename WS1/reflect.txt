I have tried to make the lab workshop, I forgot to put \n at the end of the line so this made my assignment attached to the line that needs to be at the next line.
I also realized that "*" does not need the backslash sign before it.
Everytime I have something wrong on the code like mistakes, the solution at the bottom shows there is an error in the code so that I could fix it before I debug it.

Through the workshop I was able to make program using arrays. By using arrays I was able to store several information in one variable. I could use the arrays as a set of elements, and I could easily find the elements by only using the index of it. 
Especially when I was using loops, I could use the index of the array so that I could find which number of day was it and high, low temperature of that day. 
Using of parallel array for high temperature and low temperature was making the whole function easier. Because for same index i, high and low temperature for day i was coming up and I could loop it only with single variable i, and index i.
When we are looping through arrays, the initial value usually starts with 0, it is easier because first element of array has an index of 0. For example if I have an array number = {one, two, three}, the first element is array[0] not array[1]

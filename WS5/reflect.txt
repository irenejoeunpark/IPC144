This workshop was focusing on the struct of arrays and looping using those structures. The struct of arrays made the coding easier since it could be sorted in a set of sets. For example, the struct of Employee that I used in theprogram, each arrays inside the struct had data of each employee in order of ID, age, salary and I just had to index what information I need or I need to update. 

The advantages of using an array of structs versus the parallel arrays is we do not have to make every single array when we need more information. If I was using parallel arrays I would not know how many or how long my array shouldbe and it could be so confused. Another advantage is clearly represented in my code, where I did not have to make a lot of variables and being confused every time. 

We can globally store the data for the structure Employee in a separate header file by using Employee.h, and we can simply include that structures by using ”#include “Employee.h””. This is another good way to call or store the structdata.
